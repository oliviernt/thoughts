# JS Nation - 2023-06-01

## 1. [APIs are evolving. Again. - Matteo Collina, Luca Maraschi](https://portal.gitnation.org/contents/apis-are-evolving-again)

Marketing Talk about their new product: platformatic.dev

Takeway: I didn't really takeaway anything from this talk. It was very marketing heavy and, IMO, didn't provide a lot of value.

## 2. [SolidJS: why all the Suspense ? - Ryan Carniato](https://portal.gitnation.org/contents/solidjs-why-all-the-suspense)

Very interesting Talk about Async handling with Suspense and how to think about UIs when loading async data.

Takeway: Suspense is you friend, use it to build your UI in a user friendly manner.

## 3. [Top Core Web Vitals Recommendations for 2023 - Barry Pollard](https://portal.gitnation.org/contents/top-core-web-vitals-recommendations-for-2023)

Lot's of insights about the top 9 Core Web Vitals to monitor as a developer. See https://web.dev/top-cwv-2023/

Takeway: (automatically) monitor your pages/apps for those Core Web Vitals.

## 4. [Modern Web Debugging - Jecelyn Yeen](https://portal.gitnation.org/contents/modern-web-debugging)

Presentation of the Chrome DevTools features

Takeway:
- "Emulate focused page" allows to debug dropdowns, popovers, etc...
- "Override CORS Headers" might come handy sometimes

## 5. [The core of Turbopack explained (live coding) - Tobias Koppers](https://portal.gitnation.org/contents/the-core-of-turbopack-explained-live-coding)

Nice and easily understandable explanation of the basic principles of the Turbopack implementation. Basically: recursion, caching and graph construction/invalidation.

Takeway: building up a graph and using it to prevent multiple code execution might be an interesting approach for perf in some cases.

## 6. [When optimization backfire - Ivan Akulov](https://portal.gitnation.org/contents/when-optimizations-backfire)

Explained how the Lighthouse score is calculated (10% FCP, 25% LCP, 30% TBT, 25% CLS, 10% SI). See: [https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/performance-scoring/](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/performance-scoring/)

CDNs and Cache Partitioning (aka. loading Google Fonts from Google servers won't have the cache benefits you thought)

Use `<link rel="preload"/>` when necessary

Twitter thread: [https://twitter.com/iamakulov/status/1664132124675551234?cxt=HHwWhMDR6bbWl5guAAAA](https://twitter.com/iamakulov/status/1664132124675551234?cxt=HHwWhMDR6bbWl5guAAAA)

Takeway: monitor your pages/apps for Core Web Vitals (see #3) but don't optimize prematurely ;)

## 7. [Building a Web-App: the easy path and the performant path. Why are they not the same? - Mi≈°ko Hevery](https://portal.gitnation.org/contents/building-a-web-app-the-easy-path-and-the-performant-path-why-are-they-not-the-same)

Presentation of Qwik and the core principle of resumability

Takeway: Qwik achieves high perf by using server side rendering firs and then only loading the minimal required JS for interactivity.

## 8. [Rome, a modern toolchain! - Emanuele Stoppa](https://portal.gitnation.org/contents/rome-a-modern-toolchain)

Presentation of Rome: https://rome.tools

Takeway: Rome is very fast but doesn't seem to be very extensible. Errors are nicely displayed though :D

## 9. [Dialog Dilemmas and Modal Mischief: A Deep Dive Into Pop-Ups - Hidde de Vries](https://portal.gitnation.org/contents/dialog-dilemmas-and-modal-mischief-a-deep-dive-into-pop-ups)

Dialog, Popups and Modals accessibility problems and how to solve them

Takeway: use the (web) platform instead of building custom components that are not accessible

## 10. [Package-based Monorepos - Speed Up in Under 7 Minutes - Juri Strumpflohner](https://portal.gitnation.org/contents/package-based-monorepos-speed-up-in-under-7-minutes)

Presentation of NX

Takeway: look into NX when you have time :)

## 11. [Maintaining a Component Library at Scale - Joran Quinten](https://portal.gitnation.org/contents/maintaining-a-component-library-at-scale)

Very interesting talk of how Jumbo (NL Retailer) manages their component library at scale.

Takeaway: involve the teams early in your decisions and get them to be part of the design system development.

## 12. [Accessible Component System Through Customization - Maya Sharvin](https://portal.gitnation.org/contents/accessible-component-system-through-customization)

Takeaway: again, use the platform (see #9)

## 13. [AI and Web Development: Hype or Reality - Wes Bos](https://portal.gitnation.org/contents/ai-and-web-development-hype-or-reality)

Wes gives an insight into how he's using AI to power his Syntax.fm podcast and generate side content for the shows. Very insightfull.

Takeway: AI tooling can be very powerful when used correctly. Probably takes a lot of time to get it setup though, so especially good for repetitive tasks.
